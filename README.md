# How to run the appplication

I bootstrapped this project with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

`Note`: I started out writing my own code from scratch. However, I realized I could save more time by generating the project with CRA and doing customizations myself as this is a short (4-hours long) assessment.
## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console. [Uses prettier]

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
`Note`: I couldn't write jest/enzyme tests as I had to complete it within stipulated time.

### `yarn lint`

Runs prettier linter to highlist formatting issues in the codebase.\

### `yarn lint:fix`

Runs the prettier linter utility to fix formatting issues in the codebase.\


### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!


### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

Note: This project is hosted on Netlify.\

## Other assessment  questions
### a. Approach
- Project is written in typescript because I do like to ensure type safety in my code (although currently, some loose typings <any> are used in the codebase because I was working with too much speed to allow for thoroughness.
- Initially, I had run `npm init -y` to create and customize a vanilla React project with intention to go through the entire manual process of adding typescript, setting up webpack, installing needed dev dependencies and doing every other necessary manual intricate (personal) configuration, just so I could display my acumen and skill with React setup and its ecosystem. 
- However, I had had to generate a typescript-react project with CRA 10 minutes into the exercise because it dawned on me that the exercise was meant to be a short one.
- With modularity, reusability and testability in mind, I had started out hoping to adopt the atomic software design pattern and had proceeded to create a ui/ folder in project root where I planned to put reusable components which I'd categorize as 'atoms', 'molecules', 'organisms', 'layouts' or 'templates'.
- I opted to use React Router for routing, Ant Design as UI library and Formik as Form component as requested and prettier as formatter.
